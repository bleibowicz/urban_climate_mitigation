# Overview

This repository contains the open source model code associated with the research paper "Urban land use and transportation planning for climate change mitigation: A theoretical framework." The code and paper were written by Prof. Benjamin D. Leibowicz of The University of Texas at Austin. 

The code is written for the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS). The file "urban_climate_mitigation_model.gms" includes the model structure, input data, and call to the optimization solver. It generates a file called "urban_climate_mitigation_results.gdx" that contains all model outputs after the solver is finished.
